1.	How do I approach designing software?

During our planning we selected a scene and planned out what type of objects would be required to make such a scene. We also reviewed program requirements. This made designing the actual software a lot easier and quicker. We already had a plan in place by the time the project was created. Something like this could be implemented in future work by prototyping a design on top of reviewing program requirements. Tools such as Figma can be used to draw out a layout to be created as well as planning navigation. This would be similar to selecting and planning out the scene and movements.

2.	How do I approach developing programs?

My overall strategy took basic code from the reading material then enhanced it. Luckily the program was also setup in an iterative approach, much like an agile type design. We started out laying out requirements, selecting a scene, and planning the objects required. We then started creating objects and implementing features such as camera movements. We then added more objects and lighting. By this time, we had created a complete program, one small piece at a time. When I started out it was difficult to use good coding practices. By the time I felt more comfortable with OpenGL, it became a lot easier to start organizing into different functions because I knew where different functions would need to be called.

3.	How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

A computer science education gives me a lot of experience in software development. Many of the classes also involve trying to find solutions for problems where the path is not always completely clear. This course will be useful in the fact that it has taught me more about program debugging, good software coding habits, and finding solutions to problems. It will also help my personal goals as  I do have goals that involve some 3D graphics using ThreeJS, and this gives me a foundation in which I can build on and implement, even if ThreeJS is a more abstracted library for handling 3D graphics.
